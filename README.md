# Jasons React Portfolio

## Description
This is a portfolio that was created using REACT.js. The page includes HOME, ABOUT, PROJECTS, and a CONTACT page.

## Usage
To view the app in a code editor such as VS CODE, you must first clone the repository. Then run an npm install, and lastly npm start to open. 

## Future Developments
I would like to add more functionality and style to this portfolio in the future since I didn't have enough time to complete it.
